# HungerGames

Imagine you had resources to help out the impoverished, how would you then make sure that the resources are used `efficiently`, well I try to solve this problem here, I am continually updating this repo as I come up with better ideas.

## Structure:

---

`food_prediction.py` : well from the demographic information, I aim to optimally find the group of people who need the resources the most.

`fraud_detection.py`: from the reviews or implemented schemes, I aim to automatically find if there was any fraud committed when the resources were being distributed, I aim to achieve this fine-tuning pre-trained large language models.

`route_optimization.py`: logic to find the fasted route for delivering resources.
